                <p style="width:20vw">In the beginning, I was looking to practise PostgreSQL, Java Swing and Java JDBC Connections.
                    PostgreSQL is a popular SQL language and was therefore a reasonable choice for the project. Java is the programming
                    language that is most familiar to me.

            <div style="clear:left;">
                <p style="width:20vw;">Now that I knew what I wanted to practise, I needed a good project with lots of reasons to
                    practise. I opted for a password storing application based on popular apps such as 1Password. The basic principle
                    is that a user only need remember one, secure password and that this will grant them access to all of their
                    other login details, since the main password is deemed sufficiently secure.

            Stored Procedures and Functions
        </h3>
        <div>
            <p>I was aware that you could make your own procedures and functions but wasn't sure how to go about
                doing that. It became immediately apparent as I looked for a way to delete, search, add accounts and all
                the other bits that this was what would be needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stored Procedures can be made with the syntax:
            </p>
                <pre><code>
                    CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name
                    (argname1 argtype1, argname2 argtype2)
                    LANGUAGE plpgsql
                    AS $$
                    DECLARE
                    BEGIN
                      body
                    END; $$
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    The language option could be SQL, C, internal or plpgsql, which is what I opted for. It would be interesting
                    to look into the other options and practise them too, but that was not necessary for the password storer. It
                    would, however, be something that I could consider when or if I develop this project further.
                </p>
            <p>
                Functions can be made with the syntax:
            </p>
                <pre><code>
                    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name
                    (argname1 argtype1, argname2 argtype2)
                    RETURNS return_type
                    LANGUAGE plpgsql
                    AS $$
                    BEGIN
                      body
                    END;
                    $$
                </code></pre>
            <p>
                Functions are different to procedures but broadly very similar. They can return values and even tables. In the 
                Password Storer I even dabble with returning a table in my search function (which returns a table of all the 
                user's passwords that match the search criteria).
